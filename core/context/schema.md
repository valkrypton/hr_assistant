`person_week_log` row exists at all for a person + week combination.

## Business Rules

### Employment Classification
- **"employed"** = `employment_type.type IN (1, 4, 5)` (Employee, Intern, EOR)
- **"subcontractor"** = `employment_type.type IN (2, 3)` (Contract, Sub-contractor)

### Active vs Exited Employees
- Use `person.is_active = true` to filter active employees.
- Use `person.separation_date IS NOT NULL` to identify exited employees.
- For resignations specifically: query `users_personresignation WHERE separation_type = 2 AND status = 1`.
- For terminations: `users_personresignation WHERE separation_type = 3` or `person.status_id = 12`.

### Bench / Non-Billable
- A person is on bench when their current `person_team` assignment (`end_date IS NULL AND is_active = true`) has `billable = false`.
- Long-term bench: `pt.start_date <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 'N days'` on a non-billable active assignment.

### Log Compliance
- Missing log = no `person_week_log` row for a given `week_starting`, OR `is_completed = false`.
- Always exclude employees on approved leave (`leave_record.status = 1`) when checking compliance.
- Use `holiday_record` to also exclude company holidays.

### Utilisation
- Utilisation % = (billable hours / total logged hours) × 100 over a period.
- Billable hours: `person_week_project` JOIN `person_team WHERE billable = true`.
- Total hours: `person_week_log.hours + person_week_log.minutes / 60.0`.

### Competency / Performance
- A person's role and level: `person_competency (status=2, is_enabled=true)` → `competency_role` → `competency_level`.
- **There is no `hr_records` table.** For queries about warnings or performance issues, use
  `core_personstatushistory` (status transitions) and `person_week_log` compliance gaps as
  operational proxies. Always state in the response that direct HR warning records are unavailable
  and results are proxy indicators only.

### New Joiners
- Count employees hired in a given year: `WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM person.joining_date) = <year>`.
- Break down by classification: join `employment_type` and group by `employment_type.type`.

### Attrition / Resignations
- Join `users_personresignation` on `person_id` to get exit records.
- For same-year joiners who also left: compare `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM joining_date)` with `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM last_working_day)`.
- Years of experience at exit: `last_working_day - person.joining_date`.
